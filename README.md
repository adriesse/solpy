This started out as a fairly crude calculator to go from a fisheye panorama to a csv of vectors, however there were several peices that were added to make it a bit more useful.  Daniel Thomas did work adding the Tang evacuated glass tube model.  There is also a simple module for reading in TMY3 data and limited support for calculating irradiance on an inclinded surface.  It's still in an unpolished state, but is slowly becoming more functional.
